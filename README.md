# reconstructing-transformer

Set of notebooks used to demonstrate how transformers work using code and real data.

### Notebooks

* `encoder-decoder-for-machine-translation.ipynb` - using vanilla architecture of encoder-decoder transformer for German to English machine translation
* `reconstructing-transformer.ipynb` - notebook with exploration of transformer code connected to equations from the paper
* `vision-transformer-for-mnist.ipynb` - notebook with minimal implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification using MNIST

### Sources

Source code contains minimal implementation of ViT model using PyTorch. 

### Requirements

To run it is best to use `Dockerfile` provided in the repository. It contains all necessary dependencies.
